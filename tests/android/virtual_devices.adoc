= UI Tests on Virtual Devices

To ensure that your Android app runs seamlessly on the exact devices
your user base owns, buddybuild supports numerous mobile devices across
different OS versions and vendors. Select which virtual devices to run
your UI tests against, and buddybuild automates the rest!

[NOTE]
======
**Why run UI tests on virtual devices?**

Depending on the set of tests, running UI tests on virtual devices might
lead to faster test runs. Virtual devices are created on-demand, and as
such, there is essentially no contention for a device resource.

Virtual devices are not charged per minute, so using virtual devices is
a good compromise in terms of speed, results and cost.

== Run UI tests on virtual devices for a specific branch only

You can also run UI tests on virtual devices for a specific branch by
creating a **branch-specific override**.

Under Override build configuration, click **Add a branch** and select
the branch you would like to run UI tests on virtual devices for.
