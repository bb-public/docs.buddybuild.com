[NOTE]
======
**Why run UI tests on physical devices?**

Running UI tests on physical devices could expose issues that may not
manifest when running on virtual devices. In addition, based off the
type of test, running on physical devices could lead to overall faster
test run times.

**Each physical device is charged per minute of use**. Depending on the
type of device and contention, there may be a delay before your tests
run.

== Setting up default UI tests on physical devices

You can set up default UI tests on physical devices that will apply to

select the branch you would like to run UI tests on physical devices
for.
