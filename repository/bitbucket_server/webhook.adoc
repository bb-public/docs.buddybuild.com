= Adding a Bitbucket Server Webhook

A webhook notifies buddybuild of code changes you make to your repo.
Whenever a new change is pushed to Bitbucket Server, buddybuild will
automatically kick off a new build -- ensuring you have up-to-date build
status and your testers have the very latest builds.

**Step 1: Copy the webhook URL from buddybuild**
On the Builds page, in the red banner at the top of the page, click on
**Resolve this issue**.

In the dialog box that appears, **select and copy the webhook URL**.
This URL is specific to your app and will be used to identify your app
when sending webhooks from Bitbucket Server.

**Step 2: Add a new hook if the Web Post Hooks Plugin is not already installed **
In Bitbucket Server, navigate to the repo that contains your app. In the
left navigation pane click **Settings**, then click on **Hooks**.

Bitbucket Server provides a plugin called *Post-Receive WebHooks*, which
is listed in the *Post receive* section of the *Hooks* page. If the
*Post-Receive WebHooks* plugin has already been installed then you can
skip ahead to **Step 5**. If the *Post-Receive WebHooks* plugin has not
listed, then you can add the plugin by clicking on the **Add hook**
button.

development. Click **Search** to visit the marketplace.

**Step 6: Enter the buddybuild webhook URL**
Enter the buddybuild webhook URL that you copied from Step 1. Then click
**Enable** to close the webhook editor dialog and enable. The next time
that you push code code to your repository buddybuild will create a
build for your app. Please remember that you will need to install a
separate webhook for every app in buddybuild.
