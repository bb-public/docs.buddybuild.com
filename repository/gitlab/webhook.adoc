= Adding a GitLab Webhook

A webhook notifies buddybuild of code changes you make to your repo.
Whenever a new change is pushed, buddybuild will automatically kick off
a new build -- ensuring you have up-to-date build status and your testers
have the very latest builds.

Let's get started!

On the Builds page, in the red banner at the top of the page, click on
**Resolve this issue**.

In the dialog box that appears, **select and copy the webhook URL**.
This URL is specific to your app and will be used to identify your app
when sending webhooks from GitLab.

**Settings dropdown**.
