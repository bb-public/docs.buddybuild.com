.Continuous deployment & instant delivery
--
Choose to deploy your app with every build, or on a schedule that works
for you and your team -- no review process needed. For iOS developers,
the headaches of dealing with code signing, provisioning profiles and
testers’ devices are over. Beta testers and stakeholders get a
streamlined, "one click" install experience as buddybuild manages
provisioning profiles and devices for you. Then, when you’re ready, use
buddybuild to submit directly to the App Store and Play Store.
