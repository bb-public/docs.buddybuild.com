= Ruby dependencies

Many tools that conduct or assist various kinds of builds are written in
link:https://www.ruby-lang.org/[Ruby], a popular open source scripting
language that balances functional and imperative programming.

As Ruby is evolving fairly rapidly, many Ruby-based tools function best
(or at all) only with specific versions of Ruby. Buddybuild provides
Ruby and a number of common Ruby tools, such as RubyGems and Bundler,
but these may not be at the versions that are suitable for your project.
This section describes how to use a specific version of Ruby, how to
install a Ruby when necessary, and how to specify Ruby dependencies.

The current Ruby versions on buddybuild VMs are:

[[switch]]
== Switch the active version of Ruby

Only one version of Ruby is active at a time; the default active Ruby
for each platform is noted in the table above. If your project requires
a different version of Ruby, you can use the `chruby` command in a
link:../custom_build_steps.adoc[custom build step], to switch to the
specific version you need. Each custom build step runs independently, so
execute `chruby` in every step that you require.

For example, to use a specific version of Ruby immediately after
buddybuild clones your project's source code, include the `chruby`
command in the `buddybuild_postclone.sh` script:

[source,bash]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bash

chruby 2.3.1
----

This example switches the current `ruby` to version 2.3.1.


[[install]]
== Install a specific version of Ruby

If your project requires a version of Ruby that is not already
installed, use the `ruby-install` command in a
link:../custom_build_steps.adoc[custom build step], to download and
install a specific version of Ruby.

Once installed, the selected version of Ruby remains on the build VM
until your build is complete. However, you would still need to
<<switch>> at every build step that requires Ruby.

For example, to install a specific version of Ruby immediately after
buddybuild clones your project's source code, include the `ruby-install`
and `chruby` commands in the `buddybuild-postclone.sh` script:

[source,bash]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bash

ruby-install ruby 2.2.4
chruby 2.2.4
----

[CAUTION]
=========
Installing a new Ruby requires a notable amount of time for each build.
If possible, try to make your builds succeed with an already-installed
Ruby to avoid the time required for installation.

[[gems]]
== Gems

The community of Ruby developers shares packages of Ruby code, called
Gems (available via link:https://rubygems.org/[the RubyGems site]). The
best practice for managing Ruby dependencies for any project is to use
link:http://bundler.io/[Bundler], a RubyGem manager.

Bundler knows which dependencies your project requires when you specify
them in a file called `Gemfile`. For example:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'nokogiri'
gem 'rack', '~> 2.0.1'
gem 'rspec'
gem 'danger', '~> 5.5', '>= 5.5.3'
```

As you can see, a `Gemfile` lets you express version dependencies in
different ways. In this example, `nokogiri` and `rspec` are required but
the specific versions do not matter (the latest version of each gets
installed). The `rack` dependency requires a version that is at least
`2.0.1`, but not higher than `2.1`. The `danger` dependency requires a
version that is at least `5.5` but not as high as `6`, and also must be
at least `5.5.3`. See
link:http://bundler.io/v1.15/gemfile.html[Gemfiles] for more
information.

To install or update all of the required dependencies, run:

```bash
bundle install
```

Bundler records the Gem files that it has installed by created a
`Gemfile.lock` file. The next time you run the `bundle` command, Bundler
uses the `Gemfile.lock` file to determine whether any Gems need to be
updated. If you clone your code to another system, Bundler installs the
versions of Gems specified in `Gemfile.lock`.

The best practice is to commit both the `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock`
files to your repository.
