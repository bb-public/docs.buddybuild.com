This section describes how buddybuild builds your projects.

== Synopsis

Here is a high-level summary of buddybuild's build process:

. **Trigger** +
  A build can be triggered in several ways:
+
--
- whenever you push new commits to your repository,

- whenever a link:pull_requests.adoc[pull request] is created in your
  link:../repository/README.adoc[repository],

- on a link:schedule_builds.adoc[schedule],

- manually in the buddybuild dashboard.
--

. **Evaluation** +
  Once a build is triggered, buddybuild evaluates the build
  configuration to determine whether to link:skip_a_build.adoc[skip a
  build], link:auto-cancel_builds.adoc[auto-cancel a build] (for any
  queued or in-progress builds of the same branch), or to
  link:selective_builds.adoc[build selectively].

. **Queue** +
  Once buddybuild determines that a build should proceed, it is queued
  according to your plan level, and is executed as soon as an
  appropriate build resource is available. Builds are typically queued
  for only a few seconds.

. **Execution** +
  Once a build resource starts working on your build, the following
  steps are taken:
+
--
[loweralpha]
. Prepare the build environment according to build configuration.

. Clone your app's source code from your repository.

. Retrieve link:secrets/device_variables.adoc[device variables],
  link:secrets/environment_variables.adoc[environment variables], and
  link:secrets/secure_files.adoc[secure files] from secure storage.

. Resolve your app's dependencies.

. Perform build steps, including executing tests for successful builds,
  and any link:custom_build_steps.adoc[custom steps] that may be
  defined.
--

. **Finish up** +
  After the build is complete, whether it is successful or not, the
  following steps are taken:
+
--
- Securely store build artifacts, including link:build_logs.adoc[logs].

- Send notifications.

- For successful builds, deploy the build to testers (unless
  link:disable_a_build.adoc[disabled]).
