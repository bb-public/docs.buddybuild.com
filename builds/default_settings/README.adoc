= Default build settings

Each of the available link:../README.adoc[build] settings are
app-specific. This section describes how you can specify default build
settings that automatically apply to new apps, or that can be applied to
any applications that already exist within an organization.

[IMPORTANT]
Default build settings are available for most, but not all, of the
available build settings. If you do not find a specific setting listed
in the default build settings, you need to configure that setting for
each individual app.

This page contains the following sub-sections:

- <<access>>
- <<apply>>
