= Default build settings

Each of the available link:../README.adoc[build] settings are
app-specific. This section describes how you can specify default build
settings that automatically apply to new apps, or that can be applied to
any applications that already exist within an organization.

[IMPORTANT]
Default build settings are available for most, but not all, of the
available build settings. If you do not find a specific setting listed
in the default build settings, you need to configure that setting for
each individual app.


== How to access default app settings

. Log in to the link:https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/[buddybuild
  dashboard].

  Move your mouse pointer over your avatar in the top right corner. A
  dropdown menu appears.

. Select **Manage Org**. The **Manage Organization** screen appears:

organization", 206, 40, role="right"]
  In the left navigation, a dropdown menu exists with the current
  organization selected. Click the dropdown menu to list all of the
  organizations that you currently belong to.

. Select the organization that requires a change to the default app
  settings.

. Make adjustments as necessary to the default build settings.

settings screen",role="frame"]

Generic app settings are grouped together under the **iOS & Android**
sub-heading. Settings specific to iOS builds or Android builds are
groups together under the **iOS-specific** and **Android-specific**
sub-headings respectively.


== How to apply default settings

Once default app settings are defined, they automatically apply to any
new applications that added to buddybuild.

To apply any specific setting to already-configured applications:

.  image:img/button-magic_wand.png["The magic wand button", 63, 62, role="right"]
  Click the **magic wand** button beside the setting you want to apply
  to one or more applications. A drop-down menu appears:
