= Scheduling Builds

Scheduled recurring builds let you kick off a new build for a branch on
a set schedule. This is great when you need a new build at specific
times but might not want to kick off automatic builds on every commit.

== Create A Recurring Build

Go to the **Builds** page of your app and click the blue gear icon of
the branch for which you'd like a recurring build. This will bring up
the **Branch Configurations** window for that branch.

In that window, toggle the switch in the **Schedule builds** section to
enable scheduled builds.

In the popup that appears, choose the time and days of week to
automatically kick off a new build for your branch. To edit an existing
build schedule, just click the existing time (highlighted in blue).

That's it! From now on, you'll always have a fresh build waiting exactly
when you need it!
