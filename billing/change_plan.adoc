[WARNING]
=========
**When does my plan change take effect?**

If you are **upgrading to a higher tier**, you have access to the new
features and limits effective immediately.

If you are **downgrading to a lower tier**, the plan change takes
effect at the end of your billing cycle. This means that you get to
enjoy the benefits of your higher tiered plan for a little longer!
=========

The **Payment summary** screen is displayed:
+
