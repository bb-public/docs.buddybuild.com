= Signing up with Bitbucket

First things first! Let's sign up with buddybuild. 

Signing up with buddybuild via Bitbucket allows buddybuild to access
your iOS or Android Apps' source code. Buddybuild will associate with
your repository and build your App every time a commit is pushed by you
or your team -- ensuring you always have a green build that you can
deploy to your testers.

[NOTE]
======
**Using Beanstalk, Gitolite, TFS or any other git server?**

Follow the instructions link:ssh.adoc[here] to get started.
======

[CAUTION]
====
Buddybuild rejects connecting to repositories via HTTPS that are
provisioned with self-signed certificates.

Using a self-signed certificate could make it possible for someone to
spoof your repository and inject malicious code into your builds.
====

== Step 1: Signing up with an existing service

Let's get started by visiting the
link:https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/signup[Sign up page].
