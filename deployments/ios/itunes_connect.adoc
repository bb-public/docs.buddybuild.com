[NOTE]
======
**Apple ID with Two-Factor Authentication or Two-Step Verification**

If your Apple ID is protected using Two-Factor Authentication or
Two-Step Verification, you will need to create an
link:../../integrations/apple_2fa.adoc#app-specific-password[Create an
App-Specific Password] to deploy your app to iTunes Connect.

If you're a member of multiple development teams, you'll be prompted to
select the teams you want to connect with.

Once connected, you now have the option of changing the CFBundleVersion
Format, and the build number for your next build. You can also choose to
leave the default values and click **Continue**.

[WARNING]

point, follow the prompt to do so, then rebuild your app.

Once there, review the build details and select **Upload to iTunes
Connect**.
