= Scheduled Deployments

Scheduled recurring deployments let you push new builds to your testers
on a set schedule, allowing you to keep users up to date with your app's
latest improvements.

== Creating a Recurring Deployment

Go to the **Deployments** page of your app and choose the scheduled
option from the first drop down for your target testing group.

In the popup that appears, choose the time and days of the week to
automatically deploy the last successful build of a branch to your
testers.

That's it! Builds of that branch will now be deployed according to your
set schedule. Each build will only be deployed to a group once, so your
testers won’t be spammed if no new builds have been created since the
last deployment.
