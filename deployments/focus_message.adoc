= Release Notes

Notify users of recent changes in your app with release notes. They can
be used to as a change log for your app's latest features, or to notify
testers which specific areas they should target for feedback.

In buddybuild, release notes can be entered in two ways:

== Option 1: In the buddybuild dashboard

Within the buddybuild dashboard, select the build you'd like to publish
release notes for and enter them under the 'Deploy' tab of the build
details.

== Option 2: The text file within your repository

You can also add release notes by creating and checking in a file called
`buddybuild_release_notes.txt` in the root of your repository.
Buddybuild will automatically use the content included in this file to
build release notes.

**Note**

If you don't specify a focus message, buddybuild will automatically use
the commit message of your last commit as your next deployment's release
notes!
