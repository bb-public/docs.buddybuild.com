= Common Cordova / Ionic build errors

Weâ€™ve put together a quick guide to help teams troubleshoot the most
common causes for Cordova / Ionic build failures.

First, we'll describe the steps buddybuild performs when setting up a
Cordova / Ionic build environment. Then, we'll walk through the common
causes of build failures, and how to resolve them.

== Cordova / Ionic setup in buddybuild

First, we analyze your repository for any directories that contain the
following files/folders:

- `config.xml`
- `www`

For ionic, there's an additional requirement:

- `package.json`

If we find a directory containing the aforementioned paths, we will
perform the following steps:

=== Install Cordova and Ionic dependencies

[[code-samples]]
--
[source,bash]
----
npm uninstall -g ionic cordova
npm install -g cordova@{selectedCordovaVersion} ionic@{selectedIonicVersion}
----
--

=== Install node dependencies

In addition to installing node dependencies, you can be execute
postInstall tasks that perform additional setup required for Buddybuild
to build your application.

[[code-samples]]
--
[source,bash]
----
npm install
----
--

=== Install Bower dependency

We'll only install Bower if you've there's a `bower.json` file checked
into your project.

[[code-samples]]
--
[source,bash]
----
if [ -e bower.json ]; then bower install; fi
----
--

=== Rebuild node-sass dependency

If the node version or platform has changes, we'll rebuild `node-sass`.

[[code-samples]]
--
[source,bash]
----
npm rebuild node-sass
----
--

=== Add Cordova / Ionic platforms if necessary

If you haven't checked in your platforms folder, buddybuild will perform
a "platform add" on your behalf.

[[code-samples]]
--
[source,bash]
----
if [ ! -d "./platforms/{platform}" ]; then {framework} platform add {platform}; fi
----
--

=== Restore platforms/plugins/resources (Ionic projects only)

We'll restore your plugins/resources to ensure they're correctly setup
in your repository so buddybuild can build your application.

[[code-samples]]
--
[source,bash]
----
if [ {framework} eq 'ionic' ]; then ionic state restore --plugins && ionic resources; fi
----
--

=== Prepare platform

This is the final step to ensure buddybuild can build your application.

[[code-samples]]
--
[source,bash]
----
{framework} build {platform}
----
--

=== Pseudocode Script

Here's a summary of the steps buddybuild performs when preparing to
build your Cordova / Ionic app.

[[code-samples]]
--
[source,bash]
----
# variables
framework = ['ionic' OR 'cordova']
platform = ['ios' OR 'android']

# Install core dependencies
npm uninstall -g cordova ionic
npm install -g cordova@{selectedCordovaVersion} ionic@{selectedIonicVersion}

# Install dependencies and execute any postInstall tasks
npm install

# Install bower dependencies if necessary
if [ -e bower.json ]; then bower install; fi

# rebuild node-sass dependencies
npm rebuild node-sass

# add platform folder if necessary
if [ ! -d "./platforms/{platform}" ]; then {framework} platform add {platform}; fi

# restore platforms/plugins/resources if ionic
if [ {framework} eq 'ionic' ]; then ionic state restore --plugins && ionic resources; fi

# prepare/build platform
{framework} build {platform}

== Troubleshooting Build Failures:

Here's what you can to do quickly diagnose and likely resolve build errors:

- Clone your repo and check if your app builds locally
- Double check your third party dependencies
- Double check your platform tool versions and folders

=== Clone your repo and check if your app builds locally

It's important to make sure there are no discrepancies between your
remote branch and local git state.

Buddybuild creates a fresh clone of your code and executes build
commands on every commit.

Here's how to replicate this process and ensure your remote branch is up
to date:

- Clone your repo into a new location / folder on your machine

- Make sure that the cordova/ionic/node versions installed on your
  machine are what's being used on buddybuild

- Make sure to run the same series of commands used in buddybuild's
  Cordova / Ionic setup in the same order on your local machine.

=== Double check your third party dependencies

==== Node (package.json)

A common cause of issues is a `package.json` that specifies non-explicit
versions of package dependencies (i.e. using carets `^` and tildes `~`).
This might result in failed builds because different versions of
dependencies are being installed on buddybuild than what is being used
on your local machine.

==== Cordova / Ionic plugins (config.xml)

If the plugin versions are not explicitly defined, in other words, they
are using tildes/carets, then you might have problems very similar to
what happens with non-explicit versions for node.

There have been instances where a non-explicit version resulted in a
plugin being downloaded on buddybuild that is dependent on a newer
version of a platform tool than what is specified in your `config.xml`.

In these instances, we've had to to ask the customer to update their
platform tool versions in their `config.xml`.

[[code-samples]]
--
[source,xml]
----
    <engine name="android" spec="<insert version>" />
    <engine name="ios" spec="<insert version>" />
----
--

==== Dependency Post-Installation Steps

There have been instances where a customer's dependency invokes an
executable as a **postInstall task** (i.e. running CocoaPods). This can
lead to issues depending on the version of the executable being run.

=== Double check your platform tool versions and folders

In the past, we've seen a few cases where checked in platform folders
fail on CI machines. If possible, please avoid checking them in.

Also, make sure that there are engine entries in your config.xml for all
your platforms of interest. This guarantees that buddybuild is using the
exact platform tool versions that you're using locally.

[[code-samples]]
--
[source,xml]
----
    <engine name="android" spec="<insert version>" />
    <engine name="ios" spec="<insert version>" />
----
--

We have also noticed instances where the platform tool versions
specified in the `config.xml` are incompatible with the project and
needed to be either upgraded or downgraded.

== Troubleshooting Common Errors

=== Error retrieving parent for item: No resource found that matches the given name 'android:...'.

Typically, this error indicates that the Cordova Android tool version
specified in your `config.xml` is incompatible with your
project/plugins/dependencies on a fresh clone and installation.

To resolve this, update the Android tool spec to the latest version
available for Android in your `config.xml`.

[source,xml]
----
    <engine name="android" spec="<insert version>" />

=== MainActivity.java:*: error: package org.apache.cordova does not exist

If the platform folder is committed, this generally indicates that it's
misconfigured and cannot be built. We recommend you delete the platform
folder and then commit the change.

=== error: The app icon set named "AppIcon" did not have any applicable content.

This indicates that the ios platform tools version we're using is
incompatible with your project. In these instances, the best way to
guarantee that Buddybuild is using the exact version you're using is to
ensure that there's the below entry in your `config.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
    <engine name="ios" spec="<insert version>" />

=== Cannot find module 'shelljs'

This indicates that Buddybuild's cordova/ionic setup steps were not run
because we didn't recognize your project as a cordova/ionic project.
Please make sure that your project satisfies the prerequisites listed
under "Cordova / Ionic setup in buddybuild", namely that it at least has
the following:

* `www` folder
* `config.xml`

=== Error: Cannot find module 'unorm'

This generally indicates that there's an issue with your committed
platform directory. It's generally recommended to not commit the
directory unless you have to.

=== Error: Source path does not exist: resources/{platform}/icon/drawable-hdpi-icon.png

This generally indicates that your repository is missing a icon
resources directory for a platform we're trying to add. Our suggestion
is to make sure the icon resources directory is already submitted for
the platform in question at "resources/{platform}/icon" by using "ionic
resources {platform}"

=== "Caught exception: undefined" when building plugins

This indicates a failure that's been masked by the ionic CLI while
running requisite commands to build the plugins. Please contact
Buddybuild support so that they can attempt to manually add the plugins
using "cordova plugin add <pluginname>" and determine the actual error
message.

=== Failure to build a committed platform directory

Generally, committing any platforms directory is unnecessary and tends
to lead to build issues on CI systems. It's recommended that you delete
it as we automatically add the platforms directory on your behalf if
it's not already present.

=== fatal error: 'Cordova/CDVPlugin.h' file not found

This indicates that Buddybuild's cordova/ionic setup steps were not run
because we didn't recognize your project as a cordova/ionic project.
Please make sure that your project satisfies the prerequisites listed
under "Cordova / Ionic setup in buddybuild", namely that it at least has
the following:

* `www` folder
* `config.xml`

=== net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND (\file:///android_asset/www/index.html)

This indicates that the version of ionic cli set for you app is
outdated. We have noticed that ionic cli 2.0.0 was not copying assets
correctly into the www folder during an ionic build.

=== Error: Android SDK not found. Make sure that it is installed. If it is not at the default location, set the ANDROID_HOME environment variable.

This indicates that the version of the Cordova Android tools is too old
for our environment.

Make sure that the version of Cordova Android Tools is > 6.2.0+ under the
**Settings** tab.

=== Error: Cannot find `plugin.xml` for plugin "blah". Please try adding it again.

This generally indicates that you have an invalid plugins directory
checked in. When we attempt to add the appropriate platform using
`cordova/ionic platform add`, that will not generate the plugins
directory if the plugins directory is already present.

Our recommendation is to either fix the checked in plugins directory or
remote it altogether.
