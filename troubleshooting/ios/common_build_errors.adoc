= Common iOS build errors

We’ve put together a quick checklist to help teams troubleshoot the most
common causes for build failures.

Here's what you can to do quickly diagnose and likely resolve build
errors:

- <<rebuild>>
- <<clone>>
- <<schemes>>
- <<tests>>
- <<dependencies>>
- <<logs>>
- <<support>>


[[rebuild]]
== Rebuild without cache

Caching is one of many techniques used by buddybuild to speed up build
times. However, some build failures can be caused by a corrupted or
out-of-date cache. Rebuilding without cache is a quick way to clear the
cache and rebuild from the most recent committed code.

To do this:

. Select the build you’d like to rebuild.

. Navigate to the build’s **Details**.

  Click **Rebuild without Cache**.


[[clone]]
=== Clone your repo and check if your app builds locally

It is important to make sure that there are no discrepancies between
your remote branch and local git state.

Buddybuild creates a fresh clone of your code and executes build
commands on every commit.

Here's how to replicate this process and ensure that your remote branch
is up to date:

. Clone your repo into a **new location / folder** on your machine.

. Double check that you’re building the same target and scheme as
  identified in buddybuild.

. Open Xcode from the new location and simply **⌘B** to build your app
  locally.

Similarly, if you’re experiencing issues when using buddybuild to push
to iTunes Connect (for TestFlight or App Store deployments) make sure
that you can Archive and Export your build locally as well.

In Xcode you can do this by navigating to **Product > Archive** then
select "**Export...**" and follow the onscreen instructions to finalize
exporting.

And finally, if your builds succeed locally but still fail on
buddybuild, run the same `xcodebuild` command from buddybuild on your
Mac to make sure that there are no discrepancies.

[[schemes]]
== Share your schemes

Sharing your schemes ensures that buddybuild uses the correct build
configurations (like test targets) for your builds.

To share your scheme:

. Open Xcode.

. Select **Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme…** (or **⌘<**).

. Select the checkbox(es) associated with the scheme(s) you'd like to share.

[NOTE]
Make sure that you commit and push the changes to your repo so that
buddybuild can use them.


[[tests]]
=== Ensure that your tests pass

If your app has tests, make sure they run successfully on your Mac or
local machine.

If your tests are failing locally because of a known issue and you still
want to them to run in buddybuild, you can always opt to treat them as
warnings. This way, failed tests won’t cause your builds to fail. To do
this, go to your **App Settings** and enable the **Treat tests as
warnings** option.

[[dependencies]]
== Double check your third party dependencies


[[cocoapods]]
=== CocoaPods

One of the most common causes of build failures occurs when the
`Podfile.lock` file is missing from your repo. When using CocoaPods, the
`Podfile.lock` file specifies the exact versions that your app uses.
Without the `Podfile.lock` file, unexpected versions of CocoaPods might
be used during `pod install` on a new repo.

Please double check that the `Podfile.lock` file is checked into your
repo, as it oftentimes is in `.gitignore`.

Alternatively, you can also commit the entire Pods directory into your
repo. Buddybuild detects committed pods, automatically skips the pod
install step, and uses the Pods exactly as they’re setup locally.

In either case, run `pod install` locally, then commit and push the
changes to your repo.


[[carthage]]
=== Carthage

Make sure that the Carthage version that you set and use locally matches
the one specified in your app settings in buddybuild.

585, role="frame"]

Also make sure that your `Cartfile` and `Cartfile.resolved` files are
checked into your repo.


[[logs]]
== Review the build logs

Last, but not least, the build logs that buddybuild collects during a
build and subsequent test runs can contain errors that can help identify
problems in your project. We recommend that you review the test,
simulator, and raw `xcodebuild` logs for errors.

To access the logs:

. Navigate to the build log page.

. image:img/dropdown-download_logs.png["The Download logs dropdown", 248,
  302, role="float right"]
  Click **Download logs** on the right side of the page.

. Select an available log to download.

. Repeat the selection to download all avaiable logs.


[[support]]
== Contact buddybuild support
