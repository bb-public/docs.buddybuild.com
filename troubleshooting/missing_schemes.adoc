= Missing schemes

If you don't see your scheme, it very likely belongs to a different
target.

== Targets

Buddybuild treats every target as a separate app. So each app in
buddybuild maps to a single target in your Xcode project.

If you have multiple targets, then they should be added to buddybuild as
separate apps.

== Schemes

A scheme ties together a target with a build configuration.

If you do not see your scheme, it is very likely because the target of
the app in buddybuild is not included in the **Build** section of the
scheme you are trying to use.

Please check that the scheme matches the target of the app in
buddybuild.

== Make sure your scheme is shared

You can make sure your scheme is shared, by going to **Manage Schemes**
from the schemes dropdown in Xcode:

And then checking the **Shared** option against the schemes you want to
share:

Once you've changed this, commit the scheme to your **default branch**,
(usually `master` or `develop`) and push the changes with git. After
buddybuild has built that commit you will see the schemes available in
buddybuild.
